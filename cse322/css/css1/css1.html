        <h1>Looks Change Everything!</h1>
        <p>The display property affects how an object in an HTML Document can appear. 
        <div id='block'>Certain objects like 'div' have a default block display property.</div>See as
        The div does not wrap with the text? <div id='inline'>Say the 'div' is 'in-line'.  Then fits in
        with the text.</div> Another attribute that can be modified is its widtd and margin.</p>
        <div id='main'>This div has a width of 300 pixels with automatic margining. That means that how much
        between this 'div' from the rest is automatically adjusted.  Since the width is manually set it
        doesn't stretch across this page.</div>
        <div id='max-width'>If I want to make this 'div' mobile-friendly I would use 'max-width' so it could
        adjust accordingly.</div>
        <div id='box'>It's more than width that can be changed.  Height ,margin, border, and padding, <em>the amount of space
        around the text and objects inside the modified object.</em>  All are part of the box model of the parts of
        an html object that can be changed.</div>
