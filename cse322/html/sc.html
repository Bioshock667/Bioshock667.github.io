        <div style='background-color:lightyellow'>
        <p>As most of you may know, Bizzard Inc. has released its newest game, StarCraft II, in 2010 and
            swept across the world with popularity.  It has earned praise from many, including myself, but I 
            will be focusing on my childhood favorite, <span style='color:red'>The Original StarCraft</span>.
            As of September 2015, I will be anticiping for the release of the StarCraft II expansion, <em>Legacy of
            the Void</em>.</p>

            <p>StarCraft is an <abbr title='Real-Time Strategy'>RTS</abbr> Sci-fi video game developed by 
            Blizzard on March 31, 1998.  It gained widespread popularity and is played in many e-sports events
            even today!</p>
            <p>Most of my memories of gaming were when I got StarCraft Battle Chest for my eighth birthday.  
            I constantly played it as I read the stategy guide that came with it.  Out of frustration, I would
            use cheat codes to pass some difficult missions.  Over the years, the game got me into PC gaming and
            other RTS games as well as learning how to manage resources and strategy.</p>
            <p>Here are my favorite quotes from some Starcraft units: </p>

                <p>Because StarCraft is a Real-Time Strategy game, you control a group of buildings and units from a bird's-eye
                point of view.  You command units to move by selecting them with a mouse then click to where they will go.</p>
